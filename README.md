**Installation guide**
1. Download as zip or clone
2. Open in your editor and navigate to the directory of the project
3. Ensure pg admin is open 
4. Run python db_creation.py. This will initialize the db. **NOTE: you may need to change the port. I had a previous version installed, so I am running on 5433 rather than 5432**
5. To use the main application run python crud_application.py.

Dependencies: pg admin, python, psycopg2
